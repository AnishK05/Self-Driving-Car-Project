Using the Udacity car simulator, I developed code for an autonomous self-driving car that includes lane detection and traffic sign recognition. This project involves creating algorithms that enable a virtual vehicle to navigate autonomously within the simulator. The code integrates computer vision techniques for identifying and following lane markings as well as recognizing and responding to various traffic signs.
